## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BSV-Neil/README1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

My first night I learned some Markdown, Growth Mindset and Github!

Seattle based bitcoin enthousiast

Growth mindset is compared against fixed midset which are stagnant and mostly pessimistic. Growth mindset comes from within and you must believe in yourself.
  * 1) Persistance is Key
  * 2) Learn from mistakes
  * 3) Set goals and achieve

I recently moved from LA to Seattle in December 2018. I enjoy champagne, hiking, traveling, and yoga. Check out my github page below!

Class night two! 
WOW: I learned a lot! How to install all programs I will use to start coding! I had no idea what a termnial was, how to run and install programs not from the App store, text editors are super cool and I'm excited to learn how to properly use it and make coding a bit easier for me as a newbie. 

As a MAC user Command+SPACE automatically opens up the spotlight to enter terminal.

TEXT EDITORS
* 1) Text editors are not all the same. The ones preloaded onto your computer are very basic
* 2) Other text editors can have the power to assume the remainder of your command once you start typing
* 3) Take away - use 3rd party editor (IDE) - We are using Visual Studio Code

First command I Ran - how exciting!
