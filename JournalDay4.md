How to Get JS started in Visual Studio Code

//variables - we store data in variables
// data types - this are teh different kinds of things we can put in a variable
//flow control - how we make decisions
// functions - ways to make repeatable chunks of code

We will learn to do
Variables
half the data types
half of flow control
functions

//var instructorName;

console.log('hello world');
console.log(instructorName');
instructorName = 'Neil'

How to add a prompt
 
var usersAge = prompt("how old are you today?);
console.log(usersAge);

How to make my JS write in HTML
document.write(<h2>You Areare '  +usersAge + years old today!</h2>);
document.write('<p>' + userAge + '</p>');

if (userAge === '36')  {
    document.write ('<h2>You are lying about your age</h2>');
} else {
