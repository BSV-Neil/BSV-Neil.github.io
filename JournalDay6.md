There are 4 parts of a computer
  * input
  * CPU
  * memory
  * output
  
 The input consists of binary numbers (0 or 1 - can be instrings such as 0101 or 1100 or 0000101010101 etc) each time a string hits the CPU it is then able to process what we as humans can read and is stored in the memory and sent to output which appears on our screnes. COOL!
 
 I'm sad that the class is almsot over. I learned so much and enjoyed pushing myself to learn more later in life.
