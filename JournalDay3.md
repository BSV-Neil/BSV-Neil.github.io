Journal Day 3!
Class night Three!
We are writing in VS CODE & hope to have it save in my github.com once I hit commit...
Maybe we can see changes committed if I run git add -all

By telling the terminal "git commit" it is supposed to update changes and tell me in the terminal

command "git add --all" will notify you of changes made
then tell the terminal "git push origin master"
