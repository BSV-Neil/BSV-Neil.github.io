Class night two! 
WOW: I learned a lot! How to install all programs I will use to start coding! I had no idea what a termnial was, how to run and install programs not from the App store, text editors are super cool and I'm excited to learn how to properly use it and make coding a bit easier for me as a newbie. 

As a MAC user Command+SPACE automatically opens up the spotlight to enter terminal.

TEXT EDITORS
* 1) Text editors are not all the same. The ones preloaded onto your computer are very basic
* 2) Other text editors can have the power to assume the remainder of your command once you start typing
* 3) Take away - use 3rd party editor (IDE) - We are using Visual Studio Code

First command I Ran - how exciting!
